# My_First_Repo
this is a test repository 

Clone the Repository <br/>
    git clone <path to repo / URL> <br/>
Check the Status of your working copy <br/>
    git status <br/>
Add a file to the project on your local machine and check the Status <br/>
    git add ... //most used command is * which adds all the added files <br/>
    git status - used after the above command will show you all the files you've added <br/>
Commit the file to your local copy and check status <br/>
    git commit -m <your message> - make is a suggestive message <br/>
Push the commit to the master repository <br/>
    git push - now your code will be sent to the master repo <br/>
    git status - you should be up to date :D <br/>
Get the latest version of the project and check status <br/>
    Git pull - will update your working copy with changes that are on master <br/>
   ### Before you commit your changes ...make sure your working copy is up to date ... so execute a git pull  ### <br/>
