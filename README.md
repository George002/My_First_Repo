# My_First_Repo
this is a test repository 

Clone the Repository
    git clone <path to repo / URL>
Check the Status of your working copy
    git status 
Add a file to the project on your local machine and check the Status
    git add ... //most used command is * which adds all the added files 
    git status - used after the above command will show you all the files you've added 
Commit the file to your local copy and check status
    git commit -m <your message> - make is a suggestive message 
Push the commit to the master repository
    git push - now your code will be sent to the master repo
    git status - you should be up to date :D
Get the latest version of the project and check status
    Git pull - will update your working copy with changes that are on master
   ### Before you commit your changes ...make sure your working copy is up to date ... so execute a git pull  ###
